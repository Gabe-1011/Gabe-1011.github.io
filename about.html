                    <h2>Who I am as a person</h2>
                </header>
                <p>My path to living in the greatest city in the world has been a rough ride to say the least. Around mid 2015 during my first year as a college student studying Computer Engineering at De La Salle University in the Philippines, I had to move to New York due to my mother getting a contract to work as a nurse. Though it wasn't easy to adjust to a new culture at first, it provided me with a fresh start in terms of my career path and I decided to switch my major to Computer Science. In the few years that I've studied CS, I consider front-end development to be where I'm most comfortable at as I have an eye for aesthetics and user experience. </p>

                <h2>What I do on the side</h2>
                <p>Before studying at Stony Brook University, I first studied for two years at Suffolk Community College in Selden, New York. During my stay there, I served as Vice President for the Asian Culture Club and Senator for the Student Government Association. In my Sophomore year, I was an Orientation Leader where I helped facilitate the Freshman orientation process by helping new students register for classes and get acclimated to the campus.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm a member of the Philippine United Student Organization (PUSO) at Stony Brook University where I participate in activities related to my culture - I also was a member of PUSO Ballroom which is a dance team within the club that teaches dances such as the Jive and Salsa. While most of my days are spent hanging out with members of the club, I'm also a member of Stony Brook Computing Society where I network with fellow CS students and professors.</p>
